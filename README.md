# CT-Centering-Algorithm
Generalizable AI-based algorithm for CT image segmentation and automated centering estimation.

Contained within this repository: 
- CENTERING_CT_TRANSVERSE, which measures, plots, and analyzes the off-centering for transverse CT examinations
- CENTERING_CT_SCOUT, which measures, plots, and analyzes the off-centering for planar radiographs
- CENTERING_CARINA_DETECTOR, which 1) trains a model to detect the carina within a slice of a CT examination and 2) isolates that slice
